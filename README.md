This project explores the use of an artificially trained neural network for predicting adult glomerular filtration rate (GFR) exams at University Hospitals of Leicester, comparing the accuracy and sensitivity of the neural network's results to the traditional 2009 Chronic Kidney Diseases Epidemiology Collaboration equation without ethnicity correction.
